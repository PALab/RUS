This file contains the parameters which define
both the material being measured and the 
parameters for the inversion process.

Line #::
1 - order of the polynomial to use to estimate eigenvectors
2 - shape (0=sphere, 1=cylinder, 2=parallelepiped)
3 - number of cijs

4 - hextype - 1=VTI, 2=HTI. Type of hexagonal symmetry (Only matters for ns=5) 

5 - dimension 1 in cm (diameter for cyl. or sphere)
6 - dimension 2 in cm (diameter for cyl. or sphere)
7 - dimension 3 in cm (height for cyl. diameter for sphere)

8 - density in grams/cm^3

9 - lower frequency bound for inversion in MHz (set >1 KHz lower	than your lowest measured value)
10 - upper frequency bound for inversion in MHz (set >5 or 10KHz higher than your highest value used for THIS particular fit as defined by Line 1 of freq_data)

The order of cij depends on the symmetry type.
- Isotropic: c11, c44
- Cubic: c11, c12, c44
- Hexagonal - VTI: c33, c23, c12, c44, c66
- Hexagonal - HTI: c11, c33, c12, c44, c66
- Orthorhombic: c11, c22, c33, c23, c13, c12, c44, c55, c66
